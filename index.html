              The story of Resident Evil 0 takes players back to 1998. Reports
              have been mounting about unusual murders on the outskirts of
              Raccoon City. The city’s Special Forces division, S.T.A.R.S.,
              sends their Bravo Team - including rookie cop member Rebecca
              Chambers - to investigate. On route, the team’s helicopter suffers
              engine trouble and is forced to make a crash landing, where they
              find an overturned prisoner transport vehicle.

              In 1998 a special forces team is sent to investigate some bizarre
              murders on the outskirts of Raccoon City. Upon arriving they are
              attacked by a pack of blood-thirsty dogs and are forced to take
              cover in a nearby mansion. But the scent of death hangs heavy in
              the air. Supplies are scarce as they struggle to stay alive.

              disastrous outbreak in Raccoon City that transformed its

              Six years have passed since the biological disaster in Raccoon
              City. Agent Leon S. Kennedy, one of the survivors of the incident,
              has been sent to rescue the president's kidnapped daughter. He
              tracks her to a secluded European village, where there is
              something terribly wrong with the locals. And the curtain rises on
              this story of daring rescue and grueling horror where life and
              death, terror and catharsis intersect.

              The Umbrella Corporation and its crop of lethal viruses have been
              destroyed and contained. But a new, more dangerous threat has
              emerged. Years after surviving the events in Raccoon City, Chris
              Redfield has been fighting the scourge of bio-organic weapons all
              over the world. Now a member of the Bioterrorism Security
              Assessment Alliance (BSAA), Chris is sent to Africa to investigate
              a biological agent that is transforming the populace into
              aggressive and disturbing creatures. Joined by another local BSAA
              agent, Sheva Alomar, the two must work together to solve the truth
              behind the disturbing turn of events.
